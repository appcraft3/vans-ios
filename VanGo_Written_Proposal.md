# VanGo -- Written Proposal

### A Trust-First Community for Nomadic Van Lifers

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. The Problem

Van life is growing rapidly, but the social infrastructure around it has
not evolved.

Solo van lifers --- especially women --- face three recurring problems:

1.  **Dating friction**: Traditional dating apps assume geographic
    stability. Nomads constantly move, making long-term matching
    ineffective.
2.  **Social isolation**: Making friends on the road is difficult
    without shared context or community.
3.  **Builder knowledge gap**: Many van lifers are building or upgrading
    their vans but lack structured access to trusted peer support.

Additionally, safety and trust are critical concerns. Nomadic
communities are small and protective. Generic social apps lack
contextual verification and often feel unsafe.

Van lifers don't need more swiping --- they need: - Shared real-world
experiences\
- Context-based connections\
- A protected, intentional community

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Target Audience

**Primary Audience:**\
- Full-time and part-time van lifers\
- Digital nomads and road travelers\
- Solo female van lifers prioritizing safety

**Secondary Audience:**\
- People planning to transition into van life\
- Experienced builders willing to help others

VanGo focuses on users who value: - Mobility\
- Real-world meetups\
- Community trust over algorithmic exposure

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. The Solution: VanGo

VanGo is an invite-only, trust-based mobile community designed
specifically for van lifers.

VanGo connects people through:

### 1️⃣ Real-World Events

Users discover and join local van-life meetups.\
Connections are formed through shared attendance and real-world
interaction.

### 2️⃣ Activity-Based Social Discovery

Events are categorized by activities (climbing, hiking, skiing, etc.),
enabling natural alignment between users.

### 3️⃣ Event-Based Messaging

Messaging unlocks after meaningful participation, not random swipes.\
This prioritizes safety and shared context.

### 4️⃣ Builder Marketplace

Trusted community members can apply to become builders.\
Builders can offer structured, paid help sessions for van-related
challenges (solar, plumbing, insulation, etc.).

### 5️⃣ Invite-Only & Waitlist System

Access is gated through moderation or invite codes to maintain community
quality and safety.

VanGo's core philosophy:

> You don't connect by swiping. You connect by showing up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Trust & Safety Architecture

Trust is embedded into the product:

-   Invite-only access with moderator review\
-   Role-based access levels (Guest → Waitlist → Member → Premium)\
-   Event-based validation\
-   Community reviews\
-   Reporting tools\
-   Planned AI-assisted fraud detection

Safety is not a feature --- it is the foundation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Monetization Strategy (Powered by RevenueCat)

VanGo uses a trust-aligned monetization model through **VanGo Pro**.

### Core Principles:

-   No pay-to-win dating mechanics\
-   No manipulation-based exposure systems\
-   Revenue supports sustainability, moderation, and platform quality

### VanGo Pro Includes:

-   Priority review during waitlist\
-   Verified+ badge\
-   Increased visibility in events and map discovery\
-   Advanced builder role access\
-   Role-based monetization for trusted builders

### Builder Monetization:

Experienced members can unlock builder roles via subscription and offer
paid help sessions.

This creates: - Income opportunities for skilled van lifers\
- Peer-to-peer value exchange\
- A self-sustaining ecosystem

RevenueCat powers: - Subscription management\
- Role-based entitlements\
- Future feature gating

Monetization enhances commitment --- it does not replace trust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Market Opportunity

Van life and digital nomadism continue to grow globally.

However: - There is no dedicated trust-first social platform for van
lifers.\
- Existing dating apps are location-stable and algorithm-driven.\
- Builder support is fragmented across forums and informal communities.

VanGo fills this gap with: - A focused niche audience\
- A gated community model\
- Event-driven engagement\
- Ethical subscription monetization

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Long-Term Vision

VanGo aims to become:

-   The trusted infrastructure layer for van-life communities\
-   A platform where real-world meetups drive digital interaction\
-   A structured builder knowledge marketplace\
-   A scalable but intentional community

Growth will remain controlled and trust-first.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

VanGo is not just another dating app.

It is a protected, intentional community built around mobility,
real-world experience, and shared trust.

By combining invite-only access, event-based connections, and role-based
monetization through RevenueCat, VanGo creates a sustainable ecosystem
tailored to the nomadic lifestyle.
